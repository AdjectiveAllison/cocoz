# cocoz

A high-performance code context analyzer written in Zig that processes source code repositories and provides detailed analysis of their content.

This README was generated by running `cocoz -f xml | wl-copy` and asking an LLM to write it.

## Features

- **Multi-Language Support**: Automatically detects and processes a wide variety of programming languages including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C/C++, Rust, Go, and many more.
- **Smart Filtering**: 
  - Intelligently filters configuration files
  - Excludes binary files
  - Handles token count anomalies
  - Respects `.gitignore` patterns
- **File Type Detection**: Comprehensive support for various file types including source code, documentation, data files, and more
- **Flexible Output Formats**:
  - Overview (default): Human-readable summary
  - XML: Structured XML output
  - JSON: Machine-readable JSON format
  - Codeblocks: Markdown-style code blocks with YAML frontmatter
- **Customizable Processing**:
  - Configurable ignore patterns
  - Optional inclusion of dot files
  - Adjustable token filtering
  - Support for multiple input directories/files

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Zig (latest version recommended)
- A C compiler (for standard library components)

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdjectiveAllison/cocoz.git
cd cocoz
```

2. Build and install the project:
```bash
zig build install -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe --prefix ~/.local
```

## Usage

```bash
cocoz [options] [directory|file ...]
```

### Arguments

- `directory|file`: Directory or file to process (default: current directory)
  - Multiple directories/files can be specified

### Options

- `-f, --format <format>`: Output format (overview, xml, json, codeblocks)
- `-e, --extensions <list>`: Comma-separated list of file extensions to include
- `-i, --ignore <pattern>`: Pattern to ignore (can be used multiple times or comma-separated)
- `-m, --max-tokens <number>`: Maximum number of tokens to process
- `--stdout`: Only output the formatted content
- `--disable-language-filter`: Disable language-based filtering
- `--disable-config-filter`: Disable configuration file filtering
- `--disable-token-filter`: Disable token count anomaly filtering
- `--include-dot-files <list>`: Comma-separated list of dot files to include
- `-h, --help`: Show help message

### Examples

```bash
# Process current directory
cocoz

# Process specific directory with JSON output
cocoz -f json src/

# Process multiple files
cocoz file1.c file2.c

# Ignore patterns using multiple flags
cocoz -i "*.rs" -i "*.md" src/

# Ignore patterns using comma-separated list
cocoz -i "*.test.js,node_modules" src/

# Include specific dot files
cocoz --include-dot-files ".env,.gitignore" .
```

## Token Counting

Currently, the tool uses a simple character-based estimation algorithm with language-specific multipliers to approximate token counts. This is a temporary solution - future versions will integrate [tiktoken-zig](https://github.com/AdjectiveAllison/tiktoken-zig) for more accurate token counting using the same tokenizer as OpenAI's models.

## File Type Detection

cocoz automatically detects and categorizes files into:

- Programming Languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, etc.)
- Configuration Files (YAML, TOML, JSON, etc.)
- Documentation (Markdown, RST, TXT)
- Data Files (CSV, TSV)
- Binary Files (automatically excluded)
- And more...

## Acknowledgments

- Built with Zig
- Uses standard library components for high performance
- Inspired by the need for better code context analysis tools

## Note on Binary Files

The tool automatically detects and excludes binary files using a sophisticated detection algorithm that analyzes:
- Null byte frequency
- Non-printable character ratio
- File signatures

This ensures that only text-based files are included in the analysis.
